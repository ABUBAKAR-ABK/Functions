                       Difference between functions 

1. Function prototype : it is used to give a preview to the compiler so  
                        that it's aware that some functions exists .
                  int add ( int , int ) ;

2. Function Decleration : it is used to tell the compiler about function 
                          it is interchangeable with the prototype.
                  int add ( int a , int b ) ;

3. Function Definition : it tells the compiler about the complete 
                         implementation of the function .
                  int add(int a, int b) {  
                  return a + b;
                    }

4. Function call : it's the instruction to execute the code written in  
                   the upper function.
